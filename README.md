# ReturnGuardAI

**ReturnGuardAI** is an AI-powered system designed to detect and prevent e-commerce return abuse. It uses machine learning to predict potentially fraudulent return requests, helping e-commerce businesses reduce losses and streamline their return management process.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Predict fraudulent return requests using ML models.
- Admin dashboard to monitor return patterns and risk scores.
- CSV logging of all transactions and flagged returns.
- Integration-ready with e-commerce platforms.
- Risk scoring and case escalation for high-risk returns.

## ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Pipeline

* Uses **Random Forest** or **Logistic Regression** for classification.
* Features include return reason, user history, purchase data, and timestamps.
* Risk score calculated to prioritize high-risk returns.
* Escalation logs created for admin review.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Logging

* All requests are logged in CSV and optional database.
* High-risk cases are logged separately for escalation.
* Logs help track patterns and improve model performance.
